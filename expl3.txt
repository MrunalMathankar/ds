Sure! Let's break down the code and explain it in simple terms:

1. The code begins by importing the necessary modules, `numpy` and `multiprocessing`, which are used for numerical operations and parallel processing, respectively.

2. The function `calculate_sum(array)` is defined, which takes an array as input, calculates the sum of its elements using `numpy`'s `sum` function, and returns the partial sum.

3. The `if _name_ == '_main_':` condition checks whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module.

4. The number of available processes or threads is determined using `mp.cpu_count()` and stored in the variable `num_processes`.

5. The user is prompted to enter the size of the array.

6. The input array is created using `numpy`'s `arange` function, starting from 1 and ending at the specified size.

7. The array is divided into equal chunks, based on the number of processes available. Each chunk contains a portion of the original array.

8. A `Pool` object is created using `multiprocessing.Pool` with the number of processes set to `num_processes`. This allows parallel processing of the chunks.

9. The `pool.map` function is used to apply the `calculate_sum` function to each chunk in parallel. It divides the chunks among the available processes and returns the partial sums.

10. The intermediate partial sums calculated by different processes are displayed, showing which process calculated which partial sum.

11. The final sum is calculated by summing up the partial sums using `numpy`'s `sum` function.

12. The total sum is printed.

In summary, the code divides a given array into smaller chunks and distributes them among multiple processes for parallel computation. Each process calculates the sum of its assigned chunk, and the partial sums are combined to obtain the total sum of the array. This approach allows for faster computation when dealing with large arrays by utilizing multiple processor cores or threads simultaneously.
